# chess-ai
A simple chess ai. Practicing.

I'm building a basic chess AI to practice search algorithms, but really because I've been into chess lately and I'm curious how computer chess bots work. In the future I want to practice my tensorflow skills with an ML chess ai. For now I'll stick to plain ol' search algorithms. 


I'm trying to decide what language I'll use for all of this, but for simplicity I'll probably use JS or Python, likely the former.
