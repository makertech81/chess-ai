# chess-ai
A simple chess ai. Practicing.

I'm building a basic chess AI to practice search algorithms, but really because I've been into chess lately and I'm curious how computer chess bots work. In the future I want to practice my tensorflow skills with an ML chess ai. For now I'll stick to plain ol' search algorithms. 


I'm trying to decide what language I'll use for all of this, but for simplicity I'll probably use JS or Python, likely the former.

I want to also practice documenting what I do so, I'll be commentating on what I'm using and doing for my own and anyone else's benefit in the future.

The parts to this:
I've been refrencing freecodecamp for information on what I'll need to learn to accomplish my vision. 
It seems these are the basic components I'll need to focus on.
-move-generation
-board evaluation
-minimax
-alpha beta pruning.

# Move Generation
When considering move generation (the rules for actually moving each piece) and board visualization, there are many useful tools out there. From chess.js to chessboard.js. I'm a bit stubborn in "doing things myself" completely, however for the first version of the project I'll succumb to a lesson I've learned the hard way quite to many times. I'll just use what exists...

And with that I'll use chess.js for move gen and chessboard.js for visualization.
For these things I'll follow their documentation on their respective websites. 

Board Visiualization: **Done** - Chessboard.js
Move Generation: In Progress - chess.js?
