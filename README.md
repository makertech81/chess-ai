# chess-ai
A simple chess ai. Practicing.
I'm building a basic chess AI to practice search algorithms, but really because I've been into chess lately and I'm curious how this works. In the future I want to practice my tensorflow skills with an ML chess ai. For now I'll stick to plain ol' search algorithms.
